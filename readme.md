# Name That Facebook Friend

A game created for GVI group at Harvard to test human facial recognition abilities with familiar and unfamiliar faces.

## Setup Instructions

* Create and configure a Facebook ID in main.py
* Create and configure a Face.com ID in face_api.py (sadly face.com no longer offers the same fantastic API post Facebook acquisition)
* set "ROUNDS" in main.py to the number of rounds you want the game to run, in each round you will be shown a Facebook friend's face with the task of identifying it.  All of your Facebook friends will be included via autocomplete where you type your response.
